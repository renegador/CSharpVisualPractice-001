========================

Beginning exploration into C# and Visual C#

Today, May 3, 2013, marks the true beginning of the search towards enlightenment in C#.
This endeavor will be an ever-changing idea until my imagination (or someone elses) sparks an idea worth pursuing further.

I am currently working on this in Windows Visual 2012. The files included are all of the files copied directly from the Project folder.

The files available to work on are:

1) Form1.cs

2) Program.cs

3)Form1.Designer.cs

Any changes made are welcomed, but be sure to email me as to changes and such. Assistance on making my code more efficient are quite welcome as I am only beginning to delve into this language.
